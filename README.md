# Employee Database Management

### Background
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

### Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.

### Data Engineering
Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
